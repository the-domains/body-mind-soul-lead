You Are Stronger Than You Think

Recently I tried kayaking for the first time. Maybe it wasn't the smartest way to start kayaking, but I paddled with my sons over 4 miles to a campsite in the Sam Houston National Forest. We had to make it across the wide and busy part of Lake Conroe. By sunset. 

Did I mention it was our first time? And that we left after 6pm? And we would have to come back four miles rain or shine? 

We arrived in time to see a beautiful sunset before setting up camp. We also arrived at a discovery--for three novices (including one overweight fifty-something) we saw we were stronger than we thought.

You are, too. If you can read this 

* you can learn something today
* you can help someone today
* you can say "No" to a good thing so that you can say "Yes!" to an awesome thing

You likely have all kinds of limitations and excuses and fears, but you are stronger that you think. _Think_ stronger and try that new thing or re-try that old, failed goal.

Don't miss your beautiful sunset or the beautiful discovery that comes when you try--**_you are stronger than you think._**
