You Are Stronger Than You Think

Recently I tried kayaking for the first time. Maybe it wasn't the smartest way to start kayaking, but I paddled with my sons over 4 miles to a campsite in the Sam Houston National Forest. We had to make it across the wide and busy part of Lake Conroe. By sunset. 

Did I mention it was our first time? And we left after 6pm. We arrived in time to see a beautiful sunset before setting up camp. We also arrived at a discovery--for three novices (including one overweight fifty-something) we saw we were stronger than we thought.

You are, too. If you can read this 

* you can learn something today
* you can help someone today
* you can say "No" to a good thing so that you can say "Yes!" to an awesome thing

You likely have all kinds of limitations and excuses and fears, but you are stronger that you think. Think stronger and try that new thing or re-try that old, failed goal.

Don't miss your beautiful sunset or the beautiful discovery that comes when you try--**_you are stronger than you think._**
